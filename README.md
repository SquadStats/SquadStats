### About

SquadStats.nl is a specialized Discord bot for the game Squad, designed to help server admins manage various aspects of their community. The bot provides features such as player statistics, server stats, and even a medal system. 
SquadStats is by no means the only Squad Tool that focuses on player stats, but unlike some other stats tools, SquadStats is focused exclusively on data within a single clan or server, ensuring that data isn't compared across different servers or clans. 
This can help keep individual community data isolated for more specific clan-focused insights.
